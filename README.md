## Firmware targets
Pre-built binary targets can be copied directly to a Pico Pi. 
They can be downloaded from the links on the page for the board below or found in the uf2 folder.

Before attempting to update the firmware on your Pico make sure power supplies and any USB host devices have been disconnected (hub, keyboard, joysticks, etc.).

Push and hold the BOOTSEL button and plug your Pico into the USB port of your computer. Release the BOOTSEL button after your Pico is connected. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called RPI-RP2. Drag and drop the UF2 file onto the RPI-RP2 volume.

<img src="docs/pico-bootsel.png" />

On hardware with a faceplate the button is usually accessible through a small hole; the PICOZX Lcd board has the Pico facing inwards and you will need to reach a finger inside to press the bootsel button.

e.g. for the HDMI breadboard wiring show above use:
```sh
cp ZxSpectrumBreadboardHdmi4PinAudio.uf2 /media/pi/RPI-RP2/
```


## Audio output
There are three techniques for audio output. 
* A mixture of digital sound and PWM output, which comes in three variants.
* A DAC connected to the Pico using I2S.
* Audio over HDMI to the display.

### PWM/Digital Audio
PWM audio output comes in 3 variants, using 1, 2 and 4 pin:

| Label     | 1 Pin                  | 2 Pin               | 4 Pin                   |
| ----      | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| RP AUDIO1 | Buzzer & AY-3-8912 PWM | AY-3-8912 PWM       | AY-3-8912 Channel A PWM |
| RP AUDIO2  | -                      | Buzzer             | Buzzer                  |
| RP AUDIO3  | -                      | -                  | AY-3-8912 Channel B PWM |
| RP AUDIO4  | -                      | -                  | AY-3-8912 Channel C PWM |

High frequencies need to be filtered out of the PWM audio output and mixed with the Spectrum's digital audio.
Here are some sample designs. Please note they are not carefully designed but made from components I found lying around. 
If you create a particularly nice sounding design please let me know and I will add it to the documentation.

Separating out the Spectrum buzzer from the AY-3-8912 improves the fidelity of the Spectrum beeps.

![image](docs/Pico%202%20pin%20PWM%20audio%20filter%20mono.png)

The best audio is achieved by having separate pins for the Spectrum buzzer and AY-3-8912 A,B & C channels.

![image](docs/Pico%204%20pin%20PWM%20audio%20filter%20mono.png)

The sound is actually quite good from the 4 pin filter and at some point I will do a stero version. 

Designs that only have a single GPIO pin available can have the audio mixed digitally:

![image](docs/Pico%201%20pin%20PWM%20audio%20filter%20mono.png)

### I2S DAC Audio
The emulation can drive a PCM5100A DAC for line out audio over I2S.
It uses the RP_DAC_DATA, RP_DAC_BCLK and RP_DAC_LRCLK pin on the Pico.
Currently, only tested on the Pimoroni Pico DV board.

### HDMI audio 
HDMI builds can now output 44.1kHz audio to the display.

### Video output

#### DVI/HDMI
The following circuit shows roughly how to connect an HDMI socket; 
I have always used a breakout board...

</a>

...but this is what I think it boils down to:

![image](docs/Pico%20DVI%20over%20HDMI.png)

So far, there are three supported VGA configurations, which can be found in the various build targets.
They have all been designed with a combination of plagiarism and guesswork,
so please let me know if you have better versions and I will update this document.
#### VGA RGBY 1111
Although this is the most complicated, it is my favourite as it only uses 5 pins on the Pico. The display is slightly paler than the other two versions, which is easier on the eyes.

![image](docs/Pico%20VGA%20RGBY1111.png)

See this [CMakeLists.txt](src/vga/CMakeLists.txt) for an example configuration.
#### VGA RGB 222

![image](docs/Pico%20VGA%20RGB222.png)

See this [CMakeLists.txt](src/picomputer/picomputer_vga_zx/CMakeLists.txt) for an example configuration.
#### VGA RGB 332

![image](docs/Pico%20VGA%20RGB332.png)

See this [CMakeLists.txt](src/picomputer/picomputer_vga/CMakeLists.txt) for an example configuration.

### PS/2 Keyboards
The emulator targets can accept input from a PS/2 keyboard wired to RP_PS2_DATA and RP_PS2_CLK.
A suggested circuit is shown below:

![image](docs/Pico%20PS2%20interface.png)

The resistors and Zeners are there in case the keyboard contains a pull-up resistor to 5v on either the data or clock lines;
the data and clock lines are, in theory, open-collector with no pull-up.

I'm told most PS/2 keyboards can be run at 3.3v and the the extra components become redundant... but I've not tried with mine. 
You may find the Pico struggles to deliver enough power at 3.3v for the SD card writes and running a keyboard.

Currently there is no toggling on the lock keys (caps/num lock) and the indicator leds are not used.

### Audio Input

Due to a great deal of help from [badrianiulian](https://github.com/badrianiulian), here is a suggested audio input circuit:

![image](docs/badrianiulian_audio_1.jpg)

Suggestions to improve this circuit are appreciated and please post them [here](https://github.com/fruit-bat/pico-zxspectrum/issues/46).

### Pico pinout

![image](docs/Pico-R3-SDK11-Pinout.svg "Pinout")


### Display considerations
Firstly, the emulation does not have a screen buffer, and there is not enough RAM left to add one. Whichever dsiplay you use, it will not have exactly the same timing as the old PAL monitors. This is particularly noticable on 60Hz displays with programs on the Spectrum that try to synchronize their output with the display, or use the frame rate to control the speed of music. I'm gradually adding 50Hz modes to firmware for various boards.

### Joysticks
There is basic support for connecting USB joysticks and have them appear as Kempston or Sinclair joysticks to the Spectrum.

For joysticks to work they have to provide a HID report, which is usually the case for generic PC joypads. Some manufacturers make joysticks that don't report their behaviour and hence require custom drivers; these are not going to work.

Basically, I don't know how many different joysticks will be usable. If you are having trouble raise an issue and attach a HID report descriptor from your device and I will have a look at it.

To get this to work I have created a library which works alongside TinyUSB

build_group pico2 rp2350-arm-s
```

Copy the relevant version to your board, which can be located with:
```sh
find . -name '*.uf2'
```
e.g.
```sh
cp ./bin/breadboard_hdmi/ZxSpectrumBreadboardHdmi.uf2 /media/pi/RPI-RP2/
```

## Prepare an SD card
I have used the following SD card formats:

| |
| - |
| 2 GB FAT16 |
| 2 GB FAT32 |
| 4 GB W95 FAT32 (LBA) |

The table shows the folders used by the emulator on the SD card.
If not already present, they will be created as the emulator starts up.

| Folder | Contents |
| ------ | -------- |
| zxspectrum/snapshots | Put your .z80 snapshot files in here. |
| zxspectrum/snapshots/quicksaves | Folder for quick saves. |
| zxspectrum/tapes | Folder for .tap and .tzx tape files. |

## USB and PS2 Keyboard mappings

| Key | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| AltGr | Symbol |
| F1 | Toggle on screen menu |
| F3 | Toggle mute |
| F4 | Toggle the Z80 moderator. Cycles through 3.5Mhz, 4.0Mhz and unmoderated |
| F8 | Reload current snap |
| F9 | previous snap |
| F10 | next snap |
| F11 | Reset as 48k Spectrum |
| F12 | Reset as 128k Spectrum |
| LCtrl + F1-F12 | Quick save (LCtrl+F1 = save slot 1, LCtrl+F2 = save slot 2, etc) |
